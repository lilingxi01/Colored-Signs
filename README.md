# DefinedColorSign<sub><sup> Â· A Minecraft Server Plugin</sup></sub>

Enabling colors and formatting codes for signs.

Compiled using **API 1.17**.

## Credit

This project is a fork of [Colored Signs](https://github.com/SirBlobman/Colored-Signs).

I have removed the Legacy Notice, organized some files, and compiled it with the newest API (1.17).

## Features

This plugin is only for "No Legacy Notice" purpose right now.

All features are now kept the same with Colored Sign.
